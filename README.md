## Measurements
Crankshaft radius: 42mm <br>
Piston head diameter: 82.5mm <br>
Connecting Rod length: 147.36mm <br>
Intake valve: length 62.5mm, diameter 44mm <br>
Outake valve: length 62.5mm, diameter 34mm <br>
The cams for the outake base radius: 35mm, lift 11mm, sinusoidal curve max height at 109째 <br>
The cams for the intake valves base radius: 40mm, lift 11mm, sinusoidal curve max height at 104째 <br>

Timing was made based on max lift from cams in relation to the TDC of the pistons. Exhaust max lift was set 112째 before TDC, Intake max lift was set 108째 after TDC.
